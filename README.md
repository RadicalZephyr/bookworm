# Read all the books!

This mod allows you to select a group of books in your inventory and
queue reading them all with a single right click. Probably more useful
with a fast reading mod, like [Cat's Faster Reading
Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2690908199).

**NOTE**: if you select a stack of books/comics/newspapers etc. this mod
will absolutely cause you to read every single one of them, which may
or may not be what you want.

You can take a look at the code on Github. https://github.com/RadicalZephyr/bookworm/
